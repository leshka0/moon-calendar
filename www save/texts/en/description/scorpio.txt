Hold on Tight, now we are going deep. If the moon is all our emotions, and how do we find security and for a Scorpio, security is found in emotional intensity, I think you can have a little idea about what kind of energy do we have here. 

<br/><br/>

Scorpions are diggers. They have a natural gift to know the true – almost about everything – even before you or anyone else does. The Scorpio energy brings transformation and rebirth, and under this influence, the most important thing we might seek is the true, the wholeness of everything. 

<br/><br/>

Scorpio can’t stand anything halfway or meaningless, so under this moon, we have to be careful with a very strong tendency to seek for what would make us feel complete. Not just complete, but something that brings us a feeling of being whole, true, seen.

<br/><br/>

Be careful, is very easy to get lost in a fear of being betrayed or not seeing the whole truth of any situation. You will want to solve any mystery, and your intuition will be at the strongest it can be. 

<br/><br/>

It’s a very strong, intense and passionate moon, so be careful to control your emotional responses, here they can easily be way more strong, powerful, and even violent than what you expect it to be
