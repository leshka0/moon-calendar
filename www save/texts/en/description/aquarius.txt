Do you feel that something is simply, not fitting? As if something was out of place, but you don’t even know what is it? Don’t panic, it’s the Aquarius moon. 

<br/><br/>

This energy will sharp your analyses power, and you will feel that suddenly it seems easier to watch people and catch things that you didn’t notice before.  

<br/><br/>

Be careful to don’t compensate the inner feeling of not fitting with extra defence mechanisms or to block your emotions too much. 

<br/><br/>

It’s a great time to look to everything with a rational, logic and intelligent approach. The Aquarius Moon energy has no space for irrational and clingy matters of the heart. It is what it is, and we should be thankful for the opportunity to see things as the unusual Aquarians point of view. 

<br/><br/>

It might be a period with a sudden wish to shock others, so before trying dramatic changes, be really sure about what do you want.

<br/><br/>

In the other side, it can be a moment of messy emotions, where is hard to give a name to things you feel inside yourself – it’s so much easy to understand, fix and point the outside, no? So be careful to don’t look to cool-headed, detached, or even “above” others and situations. 

<br/><br/>

Use this energy to set realistic aspirations, don’t be too hard on yourself and your goals.

<br/><br/>

Use this wise and unpredictable moment to look at the world as if it was upside down. Analyze the strengths and weakness around you, and set a realistic plan for how can you improve things in a practical way.
