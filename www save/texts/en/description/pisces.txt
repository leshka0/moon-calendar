After the realistic and rational centring Aquarius moon, hold on tight. We are going far far away with the Pisces moon… we are going, to the skies!

<br/><br/>

The Pisces moon is known to be a dreamy state of mind, a fairytale energy. It’s time to feel our feet out of the ground, and our minds and hearts in the “What if…” land. It’s time to feel as we didn’t feel with any other moon before, it’s time to be able to understand, support, to love and incredible compassion.

<br/><br/>

It’s a sweet, easy moon – almost “spaced out”. Dreams will be side by side with reality, and suddenly everything feels lighter. Time to care about the others, to show more our affection.

<br/><br/>

Balance is the secret here. It’s wise to be able to don’t feel “too much”, dream “too much”, suffer “too much”. 

<br/><br/>

“Too much” is an easy expression found in the Pisces Energy. It’s hard to find limits in the dreamland. So be careful with misunderstandings – a lot of them might happen under Pisces moon.

<br/><br/>

Be careful with people trying to take any advantage of this positive and kind energy, and demanding also “too much”.

<br/><br/>

It’s a time to trust your intuition and to be sure that everything is always as it has to be.
