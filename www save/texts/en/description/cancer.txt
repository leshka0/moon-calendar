In cancer, the Moon is in her domicile – its potency is at the highest level. As the Moon AND the Sign of Cancer are all about emotions, this position might bring an even more “Moody” influence. 

<br/><br/>

This is a very feminine energy and influence, a time to protect – yourself and the others. Cooking, listening, considering, making you and the environment feel loved and warmed. 

<br/><br/>

It’s also a moment to deal with emotional attachments – what feelings are you hoarding? Ask yourself what do you need to let go, and why is it being so hard to give up on it. Nostalgia is a great feeling if we think that brings back to us a comfortable and warm feeling from the past, but it can become toxic if we get stuck on it, thinking that the future will never be as good as the past was. 

<br/><br/>

Under this Moon, is not so wise to take important decisions as we tend to consider everything emotionally and the rationality here might be strongly affected by feelings and unconscious material. 

<br/><br/>

This is a good time to ask yourself: What makes your heart feel at home? Prepare your self a comfort food, a warm bath. Find the mother inside yourself to take care of your most inner needs. Love is powerful and infinite, as long as you project it also in your future.
