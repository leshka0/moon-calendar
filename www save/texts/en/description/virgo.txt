Now it’s time to organize things. No, I am not being superficial and trying to say what everyone says: Virgos are crazy with the organization. This is unfair.

<br/><br/>

The truth is that Virgos are natural doers. And if anything needs to be done, they will do it. Without asking for applause, spotlights or recognition. They just like to know that everything is in the right place and everyone is happy and comfortable. 

<br/><br/>

Under this influence, you might feel an urge to organize things, a simple cleaning in your room or redoing your whole life project. It is possible to feel something hard to be named, something uncomfortable inside you, a little voice saying “everything is wrong” – even if you don’t even know yet what is it. So everything depends on how you face it – it can be very positive, and a time for self-evaluation, resetting targets and plans, or you can’t just go through this flow that something needs to be fixed but you don’t know how. 

<br/><br/>

It’s a period when instead of expressing – exploding, sharing, communicating – our emotions, we tend to be more practical, even critics about how we feel, so be careful to don’t be hard on yourself.

<br/><br/>

We feel how we feel, and a big part of a healing is accepting ours inside instead of constantly trying to change it. 

<br/><br/>

Do you know the feeling of throwing away a lot of things you don’t need, changing your sheets, taking a shower, sitting in your bed and appreciate this little moment? Feeling proud of this little thing you did for yourself? This is the Virgo joy, the ability to find happiness on little things, small details.

<br/><br/>

And remember, under this moon – instead of complaining, what can you actually do to transform this internal discomfort? How can you break the patterns that no longer bring you anything positive? How can you fix this broken watch beating in your chest? Trust, the Moon in Virgo has all the tools for it.
