This is a powerful moon that can give you the feeling of being able to do things with less effort than normal. Look to the Gemini duality: They can do at the same time two things with less effort than one person would be required to have.

This is a moon that can give you the feeling of a deep need to act on the opposite side of your true needs. Why? Cause it’s a time to don’t even understand or accept what we think we could need or want. It’s not because you don’t actually know it, it’s just because under this energy, everything can be very volatile and change quickly.

So think about nature, sometimes we have days with an extreme sun that ends with massive storms. Can you blame her? No, you can just watch the beauty of being able to change, and this is the Gemini energy.

Allow yourself to accept quick changes, but be wise to sometimes just don’t work on it immediately. Just be careful to listen to your wishes and so don’t drop them suddenly. This is a moment to listen, Gemini is the talker. Listen to this energy ideas and consider everything that might come to you.
