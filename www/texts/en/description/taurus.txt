Quite Stable Emotions, Fixed Sign, Feminine and Fertile.
In Taurus, the moon is always in exaltation, and in the most potent degree. 

<br/><br/>

Taurus a feminine energy sign, so let’s think about the feminine Archetypes: nurturing, feeding, caring, loving, grounding, are feelings that might be around us, or as our needs, when we have the Moon in Taurus. 

<br/><br/>

Some people might experience some feeling of calmness and stability when other might experience total chaos. The reason for it is that “security” is a very word with very mutable meaning for each person. For a typical Taurus, security would be the feeling of knowing that it doesn’t matter what happens in the world, there is some money left in the saving accounts “just to be sure”. A Libra for an example would care more about with who she could count on…. Safety depends on our deepest needs and wounds. 

<br/><br/>

There is a big myth that involves the Taurus: Everyone thinks they are just stubborn – well, they can be it, for sure – but the Taurus energy teaches us that is wiser to don’t waste a minimal energy if it is not worth it. Look at the impressive and huge figure of a Taurus… he will move, just when he wants to. Some people might interpret this as being stubborn when the truth is that if you look closely, it’s just another way they have to save resources.

The Moon in Taurus invites you to ask your self: what are you wasting? In what are you investing? What are the feelings that you are collecting and not ready to get rid of it?

<br/><br/>

Is it safe, to really just play safe? This is a moon that asks you if it’s the time to spend more energy trying to dare, to get out of your comfort zone? If you had today all the certainty you need, what would be worthy enough to remove you from your familiar zone?

<br/><br/>

It’s also a moon about your corporal awareness, which is absolutely amazing in the zodiac/hero journey. How are you NOW? How do your feelings express themselves inside and out of you?
