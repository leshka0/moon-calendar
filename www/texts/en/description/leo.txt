After our emotional reflexive moment during the Moon in Cancer, here we feel a tendency to express our emotions quite strongly, and sometimes even theatrical. We stop looking to the past and turn our feelings in a more dynamic way. 

<br/><br/>

Here, the Moon receives a bit of Sun’s Energy, we start to look a bit more to ourselves, our needs, aspirations. The environment becomes secondary and it is our chance to shine, to go and grab what we are looking for. 

<br/><br/>

It’s a time to analyse our self-perception. Are you playing your ruler as best as you can?  Just because we feel the sun stronger on us, it doesn’t mean that is a time to forget about the others and become a self-centred egoist. 

<br/><br/>

It’s a moment where we are the most connected to our Ego. Under this energy, we are a bit disconnected from our unconscious, is more a time where we play here and now, without needing to deeply analyse or doing things to after asking “why did I do this?”. It’s a powerful moment of self-awareness.

<br/><br/>

Be careful to don’t take everything personally and get hurt for very small things that after you wouldn’t even find important. Also, here we might have a tendency to organize and even control others people's life – it’s a moment where it’s hard to see where this expanded ego finishes, so pay attention to it.

Use this unique fusion of the Sun and Moon energy to discover more about yourself. Look at you and pay attention to what makes you glow inside. Be proud of yourself, you deserve it.
