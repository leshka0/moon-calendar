We see either the full moon, half moon or no moon (new moon) because the moon reflects sunlight. How much of it we see depends on the moon's position in relation to Earth and the sun.

<br/><br/>

And so it is the Libra Influence. The Libra influence is a period where we tend to see ourselves depending on other people, on our relations.

<br/><br/>

In the signs cycle history, is when the Moon or Sun arrives in Libra, that we turn our eyes to the outside, to the other one, and then we can see ourselves - as a reflection. A Libra Moon is a time to share, to shine. To look for the small beauties in everything, to dialogue, express, create. A time to balance our needs, considering now the matters of the heart – but especially, other’s hearts. People tend to say that Libras are indecisive, they just don’t observe that deep inside, a Libra energy is not indecisive…. It’s just a moment where we wish everyone could be happy, and they mean literally Everyone – they just don’t know that the in the real world, this is almost impossible. 

<br/><br/>

This Moon has a Venusian feminine energy, making a romantic, emotional and sweet mist around us. It tends to be a positivity and tenderness energy, and bring love and affection as primary priorities.

<br/><br/>

It can also bring a strong sense of “Fairness”. The eternal libra illusion is that the world is fair, so under this moon, we might pay attention that not everything is equal and balanced, as the libra dream would like it to be. Sometimes you give everything to receive nothing. Or the opposite. 

<br/><br/>

The balances of your mind might feel unstable, and you might be feeling a need to express, to argue, like a lawyer that has to understand and fight for one side. Understand that having the last word does not always mean winning.

<br/><br/>

If now, the other is a mirror, what do you see? Do you like this reflection? It’s ok, under this moon your answer will probably be: “I don’t know”.
